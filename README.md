# What is generative AI?

At a high level, generative AI refers to a category of AI models and tools designed to create new content, such as text, images, videos, music, or code. Generative AI uses a variety of techniques—including neural networks and deep learning algorithms—to identify patterns and generate new outcomes based on them. Organizations and people (including software developers and engineers) are increasingly looking to generative AI tools to create content, code, images, and more.

#What is generative AI used for?

Traditional AI systems are trained on large amounts of data to identify patterns, and they’re capable of performing specific tasks that can help people and organizations. But generative AI goes one step further by using complex systems and models to generate new, or novel, outputs in the form of an image, text, or audio based on natural language prompts.

Generative AI models and applications can, for example, be used for:



## Main Steps

1. Upload and read pdf: [use azure cognitive services (Computer Vision API) or nodejs library to convert to text]
2. New account for openai, keys are already expired [Only if Palak's Keys don't work]
3. Preprocess the text file in the backend [Partially done in python code]
4. Create prompt
5. Create token thing, temp < 0.5
6. Sending token and process the response token
7. Integrate with CLI
8. Make it interactive and enhance UX.

## Research 

Task 1: Study and list what all to be included in token(request) : Finetuning of Request and Processing of Response<br>
Task 2: Azure PDF service : Read and Process the text extracted<br>
Task 3: CLI Tool usage<br>
Task 4: Integration with Azure<br>
